# EntanglementEntropy.jl

A project for the Computational Physics UW course (module III), by Laura Sberna. In this project, we study the growth in entanglement entropy of a separable state in a one dimensional spin chains. We study two possible hamiltonians, including the Ising model.

Below is shown the entanglement entropy over time for the modified Ising model Hamiltonian, N=12 spins.
